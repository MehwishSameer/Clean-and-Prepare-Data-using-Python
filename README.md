## Pre-Learning

- [Introduction to Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/python-data-science/?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella)
- [Introduction to the NumPy and pandas libraries for data science](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/pandas-data-science/?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella)

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- VS Code

## What students will learn

The first thing you'll need to do with any dataset is to clean it up. Many datasets have missing information, or won't be formatted in the exact way you'd like. In this workshop, you will learn how to use data science libraries to prepare your data for analysis and visualization.


## Introduction

In this section, you'll review an [introduction](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/data-manipulate-clean/1-introduction?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella) and make sure that your data science environment is set up correctly before continuing on to the next part of the workshop.

## Explore DataFrame information

Next, you will learn how to use Python libraries to [explore an iconic dataset](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/data-manipulate-clean/2-explore-dataframes?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella). You will be able to understand how to use pandas DataFrames to get an immediate idea about the size, shape, and content of a particular dataset. 

## Work with missing data

Now that you know how to get an overall sense of the dataset you are working with, you will learn [how to identify and  deal with missing values](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/data-manipulate-clean/3-missing-data?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella).

## Remove duplicate data

Another common thing you'll have to do with most datasets you encounter is [remove duplicate data](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/data-manipulate-clean/4-duplicate-data?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella). In this section of the workshop, you will learn how to use pandas to detect and remove duplicate entries.


## Exploratory statistics and visualization

So far, you've learned how to use pandas methods to examine some aspects of a DataFrame, and fill in, remove, and combine data. The final way we will seek to understand our data is by [creating visualizations](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/data-manipulate-clean/6-exploratory-statistics-visualization?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella).

## Practice

To test your knowledge, try downloading a free dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) that you find interesting. Use the techniques that you learned in this workshop to manipulate and clean your data!
